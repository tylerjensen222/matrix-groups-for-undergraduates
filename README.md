Each solution is as true as the author assumes them to be. Please keep this in mind!

There are various tags, [TODO], [WIP], and [Complete], which mean the obvious things.
There may be instances where a solution appears complete, but has a [WIP] tag. This is because the author has made a boneheaded mistake and needs to revisit.
